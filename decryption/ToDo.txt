(1) Finish buildkey.c

(2) Finish decrypt.c

(3) Build an analyzer

	[+]	Get useful data out of the words dictionary - this info will be hard 		coded into our code to assist in the cracking of messages

		-> average word length
		-> average length of word starting with each letter
			(i.e. average length of words that begin with a, average 				 length of words that begin with b,â€¦) 
		-> average length of word ending with each letter

		-> frequency of each letter
		-> frequency of words starting with each letter
		-> frequency of words ending with each letter

		-> frequency of letter pairs
		-> frequency of words beginning with each letter pair
		-> frequency of words ending with each letter pair

	[+]	Get useful data out of the cipher

		-> frequency of characters
		-> frequency of pairs of characters

	[+]	Make an educated guess as to what the keys may be
	
		-> make rules as to how to construct key (i.e. the character to the 				left and the right of an encoded space cannot be a space, b/c 			two consecutive spaces will never occur.

	[+]	Decrypt using that key

	[+] 	Check if decryption is correct
		
		if not:
		-> determine how incorrect (spell check)
		-> try and get some useful info that will help in the next decryption 		 	attempt
